    <h1>Blue Light and Screen Exposure</h1>

    <p>
      Blue light is a type of visible light with a short wavelength that is commonly emitted by
      technology devices such as smartphones, computers, and televisions. Blue light plays an
      important role in keeping people alert during the daytime. However, research suggests that
      at night, exposure to blue light can raise cortisol compared to darkness, which may interfere
      with the body's normal wind-down process.
    </p>

    <h2>Why is this important?</h2>
    <p>
      This matters because cortisol normally drops at night so the body can relax and prepare for sleep.
      If cortisol stays higher, you may feel more alert, which can make it harder to fall asleep or stay asleep.
      Over time, poor sleep can affect mood, focus, and energy levels during the day. That is why many people
      try to reduce bright screen use late at night.

    <h2>Blocking blue light at night</h2>
    <p>
      It can be helpful to reduce blue light exposure in the evening to support a consistent sleep schedule.
      Small changes can make a difference, especially if you use screens close to bedtime.
