            <h1>Welcome to the Mesa Car Collection!</h1>
            <p>
                This page is a full showcase of my top cars I would want to own in my future
                collection. Cars have always been a passion of mine, and I love learning about
                different makes and models. Here are some of my favorites:
            </p>
            <h2>Featured Cars:</h2>
            <ul>
                <li>2nd Generation 2023 R8 GT Performance</li>
                <li>2024 Koenigsegg Gemera</li>
            </ul>
        </div>

        <div id="r8">
            <h2>2nd Generation 2023 <span class="R8_RED">R8 GT Performance</span></h2>
            <img src="./images/red_r8.avif" alt="2023 Audi R8 GT Performance" id="r8_pic"/>
            <p>
                This car has always been one of my favorites due to its sleek design and powerful V10 engine. 
                Since being a kid Audi always caught my atttention, they seemed sleek, fast, and luxurious all at once. 
                Its literally so beautiful and when you see it in person its even more breathtaking. Everytime I see one 
                on the road I cant help but freal out its almost as if I turn into a little kid again seeing a supercar for the first time.
                With its impressive performance and cutting-edge technology, the <span class="R8_RED">R8 GT Performance</span> is a true masterpiece on wheels.
