    <h3><b><u>Introduction</u></b></h3>
    <p>
        Autonomous vehicles (AVs) are rapidly advancing technologies that promise to reshape transportation systems worldwide. The only issue is 
        public trust in AV safety remains a critical challenge. I aim to analyzes crash reports and disengagement data from autonomous vehicle 
        companies operating in California, using datasets collected between 2014 and 2020.
        <br><br>
        The goal of this analysis is twofold: (1) to assess the patterns and severity of AV crashes, including injury outcomes and crash locations 
        in California, and to examine system reliability through disengagement metrics like total disengagements, miles driven, and disengagement rates over time.
        <br><br>
        Through visualizations of crash density, company performance comparisons, and system reliability trends, this project provides insights 
        into both the current limitations and promising improvements in autonomous vehicle technology.

    <h3><b><u>Assessing AV System Reliability Through Disengagement Rates</u></b></h3>
    <p>
        The storyboard below evaluates the reliability of autonomous vehicle (AV) systems by examining disengagement reports collected from companies 
        operating in California. Disengagements occur when the driver must take control of the AV system, either manually or automatically due to an issue 
        that either the system sees or the human sees.
        <br><br>
        The visualizations first present total disengagement counts and miles driven by company to provide context for operational exposure. I next 
        choose to show the normalization performance using metrics such as miles driven per disengagement and track disengagement rates over time.
        <br><br>
        These analyses highlight both company-specific performance differences and industry-wide improvements in system reliability as AV technology matures.

    <p>
        Disengagement rates serve as a critical indicator of AV system reliability. Specifically in the above storyboard the last visual shows a consistent
         decrease in disengagements over time, this analysis demonstrates measurable improvements in AV technology performance which supports the case for 
         increasing safety and maturity in autonomous systems in the past few years.

    <h3><b><u>Crash Patterns and Injury Outcomes in Autonomous Vehicle Operations</u></b></h3>
    <p>
        This section examines crash patterns and injury outcomes from autonomous vehicle (AV) operations reported in California. By analyzing where crashes 
        occur, the severity of incidents, company-specific crash counts, and road types involved it will better help us understand the remaining challenges 
        faced by AV systems during real-world deployment.

    <p>
        Studying crash patterns and injury outcomes is important when evaluating the safety and operational maturity of autonomous vehicles.
        <br><br>
        The heatmap reveals geographic concentrations of crashes which helps us understand that complex urban environments as testing challenges. 
        The injury outcomes chart shows that while most AV crashes do not result in injuries, safety incidents still occur meaning they are not perfect 
        yet since this is one of the main reasons for creating autonomous vehicles. Comparing crash counts across companies provides insights into operations scale 
        and performance differences while analyzing crashes by road type identifies the kinds of driving environments where AVs are still most vulnerable.
        <br><br>
        Together, these crash data points complement disengagement analysis by illustrating that although AV systems are becoming more reliable actually 
        navigating real-world environments remains a critical problem on the path toward full autonomy.

            <h3><b><u>Challenges Encountered and Addressed</u></b></h3>
            <p>
                While I was working on my project, I encountered several issues. Some encountered are when 
                cleaning and visualizing the data. Originally, when building the crash heatmap, only a single 
                point appeared on the map because the latitude and longitude fields were not properly assigned 
                which needed me to reconfigure the data source to correctly map geographic coordinates.
                <br><br>
                Another challenge involved preparing the injury outcome data. The injury field had inconsistent 
                entries, making it necessary to create “calculated fields” that cleaned and categorized the data 
                into a simple “Yes” or “No” outcome for injuries. Setting up the pie chart visualization made me 
                manually create a counting mechanism because Tableau did not automatically recognize the need to 
                aggregate “Yes” and “No” outcomes separately.
                <br><br>
                These challenges were fixed through calculated fields, reorganization of the data structure inside 
                Tableau, and adjustments to field aggregations to make sure correct visual outputs.

            <h3><b><u>Design Decisions</u></b></h3>
            <p>
                Each visualization I used with the intention to best represent specific aspects of the autonomous 
                vehicle (AV) data and aligns with my project’s goal of demonstrating technological improvement. A 
                heatmap was used to visualize crash locations, as it effectively conveys spatial density and highlights 
                geographic patterns of incidents. Pie charts were selected to represent injury outcomes because they 
                provide a fast, intuitive understanding of proportions between injury and non-injury events.
                <br><br>
                Bar charts were used to compare total disengagements, miles driven, crashes by company, and crashes 
                by road type, allowing for straightforward comparison between different things in the study. Finally, 
                a line chart was used to visualize disengagement rates over time, as line charts are ideal for highlighting 
                trends and demonstrating improvements over multiple years. These design decisions were made to maintain 
                clarity, audience engagement, and to directly support the narrative that AV systems are becoming more 
                reliable over time.

            <h3><b><u>Future Work</u></b></h3>
            <p>
                While my project was focused on crash and disengagement data from California between the years 2014 and 
                2020 when thinking about future work I could expand the analysis in several ways. Incorporating more 
                recent data would provide a clearer view of current trends especially as AV technologies continue to evolve. 
                Also increasing the scope beyond California to include additional states or countries would help generalize 
                the findings and assess how AV systems perform under different regulatory, geographic, and traffic conditions.
                <br><br>
                Additionally in future analysis I could examine more detailed crash severity metrics for example like property damage levels 
                or near-miss incidents and correlate them with disengagement patterns to better understand predictive indicators of risk. 
                These extensions would offer a more comprehensive evaluation of AV safety and readiness for widespread deployment.

    <h3><b><u>Conclusion</u></b></h3>
    <p>
        As the time continues to cause us to evolve in our technological ways autonomous vehicles are definitely a must for the foreseeable future. 
        According to my analysis autonomous vehicles show measurable improvements in system reliability, with disengagement rates decreasing over time. 
        However, crash patterns reveal that full operational safety across complex environments is not yet perfected but on the rise. We need to continue 
        improving the AVs and the best way to do so is through innovation and accountability since it will be the most important as AV technologies move closer 
        to widespread usage across the United States.
